::: Changes

Overview. This is a major upgrade, with many breaking API changes. But the
breaks are generally minor. For example, due to package refactors or changed
argument names.

[high-level]

API-break. There has been a heavy refactor to packages. There is now a clear
hierarchy to them. This is obvious in the import order in solent/__init__.

    Summary of the new package arrangements
    =========================================
    paths: allows solent to get its orientation in the filesystem.

    base: foundation of the system. Memory control, namespaces, unit testing
    tools and logging are here. We have put just enough function in here to
    bootstrap Interface Script. This means we can use Interface Script as a
    DSL building block anywhere in the system that is above this base.

    eng: The engine, orb and nearcasts.
    =========================================

API-break. SolentQuitException has moved. If you were importing it from
engine, that will need a refactor to solent.SolentQuitException.

API-break. Logs are now offered through the root solent package. This
includes hexdump. This will break almost everything that uses solent at the
moment. It is a fast fix: just change package imports for log, hexdump_bytes
and hexdump_string.

API-break. RailLineFinder has become a base class (to support interface
script.) Its argument API and callback API has changed to match convention.

Polish. Several things which used the old convention of using "thing_new"
functions for construction have been moved to the new convention of using
"Thing" classes. The old way was a legacy of the original C codebase. The new
way creates less friction with python users. (This is not always a reason to
do things, but it does us no harm here.)

Polish. The fake package is now more effective as a fake package.

Polish. Internals of lots of classes have been refactored so that rail_h now
gets passed as a callback, so that call methods are structured at the top of
classes, and to replace bespoke callback classes with references to solent.ns.

Polish. Scenarios have been improved, but there is still a lot of room for
improvement in scenarios.

[menu]

API-break. What was BrickMenu has become solent.console.RailMenu. Its
parameter of menu_h has changed to rail_h.

[hexdump]

API-break. A further change to hexdump_bytes. Its receive argument is now bb.
Previously it was arr. This brings it in line with convention, to refer to a
list of bytes as bb.

Bugfix. There was a formatting bug in hexdump functionality when a byte lined
up with the edge of a string or similar. It is a minor visual fix.

Feature. There is now a hexdump tool, similar to unix "hexdump -C". It was
written for Haiku usage, and will also be useful in Windows.

[line console]

API-break. The package solent.lc is gone. SpinLineConsole has been moved to
solent.util. In a future release, this will be refactored to RailLineConsole
(issue 100).

[orb]

Bugfix. Orb messages did not count as 'activity'. This created situations
where the engine would have short sleeps between cycles. The engine is not
meant to sleep between cycles when work is happening.

Polish. We now profile Tracks to check their structure, and to give more
helpful messages when they are mis-structured.

[cformat]

API-break. There was a weird cformat module in solent.log. This was a legacy
of the roguelike codebase that solent evolved from. It predates the current
console model, and offers simple text formatting when printing directly to
TTY. It has a bit of value, so has been kept in solent.util. (It is used by
only a couple of sections of this codebase, both of them also in line for a
shakeup: gruel and redis.)


// Opening comment

The platform has a history of big-bang releases. We are moving towards a
model where we use issues to drive changes. The improvement will be gradual
