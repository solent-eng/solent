# We don't want to commit shared libraries to the tree. If you have particular
# libraries that you do want in source control, stick them in the
# artifact/[platform] directory. i.e. This would not be good for tools derived
# from source mastered in src. But it could be good for something like
# libsoundio. Put it in artifact.
